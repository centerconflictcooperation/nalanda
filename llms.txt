## About the Name

The package is named after [Nalanda
Mahavihara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda), one of the most
renowned centers of learning in ancient India. Founded in the 5th
century CE, Nalanda was a Buddhist monastic university that attracted
scholars from across Asia and became a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, and
the pursuit of learning through texts and collaboration.

This name is particularly fitting for a package related to the study of
books and prosociality, reflecting the historical significance of
Nalanda as a center for both scholarly texts and the cooperative
exchange of ideas. The connection resonates with contemporary research
on how books and shared learning can foster prosocial behavior and
cooperation.
