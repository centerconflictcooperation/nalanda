\usage{
run_ai_on_chapters(
  book_texts,
  context_text,
  question_text,
  n_simulations = 1,
  temperature = 0,
  seed = 42,
  base_model = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
  virtual_key = getOption("nalanda.virtual_key"),
  base_url = getOption("nalanda.base_url"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{book_texts}{A single character (one chapter) or a nested list of books -> chapters as returned by \code{read_book_texts()}.}

\item{context_text}{Character vector. Context used in the baseline prompt to establish party identity.
Can be a vector of multiple contexts - the function will run once for each context and combine results.
Example: "You are simulating an American adult who politically identifies as a Democrat."}

\item{question_text}{Character. Question to ask the model in both baseline and post-intervention turns.
The post-intervention turn will append " after reading this chapter?" to this question.
Example: "On a scale from 0 to 100, how warmly do you feel towards your political outgroup?"}

\item{n_simulations}{Integer. Number of repeated simulations per chapter (each simulation = 2 chat turns).}

\item{temperature}{Numeric. Sampling temperature passed to the chat backend.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility (incremented for each simulation).}

\item{base_model}{Character. Model name to label results with.}

\item{virtual_key}{Optional API key/virtual key prefix used by chat_portkey.}

\item{base_url}{Optional base url for API calls.}

\item{excerpt_chars}{Integer. Number of characters to keep as excerpt in results.}

\item{include_tokens}{Logical. Return token counts if available (summed across both turns).}

\item{include_cost}{Logical. Return cost info if available (summed across both turns).}
}
\value{
A tibble of results, or a named list of tibbles (one per book). Each row represents
one simulation and includes: \code{chapter}, \code{sim}, \code{party}, \code{baseline_score} (pre-intervention),
\code{score} (post-intervention), \code{chapter_excerpt}, \code{context}, and \code{question}.
The object has class \code{nalanda} and an attribute \code{model} with the model name.
}
\description{
This function implements a two-turn sequential chat design to measure the effect
of reading book chapters on attitudes. For each simulation, the function:
\enumerate{
\item Establishes a baseline by asking the model to choose a party and rate the outgroup
\item Shows the chapter and asks for a post-intervention rating in the same chat session
}
This design creates a within-agent pre-post comparison, with conversation memory
maintained between turns.
